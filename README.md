# Introduction

**git-refresh** automates pulling your git managed repositories
as soon as you `cd` into them.

No command, no fuss required. Just plain old-fashioned simple automation.

Hope it saves you some time and hopefully some frustration overtime.

Project aim is that you never see the following git error warning 

```
To https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
  ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git'
To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
```

Hail Automation! :)

## Demo

## Install

```fish
$ fisher install PJC-64/git-refresh
```


## Usage

Upon successfull installation, just relax and let the
plugin take care of pulling git repo as soon as you
cd to any *git managed* directory.

It executes automatically. :relaxed:
